== Introduction

Pocket Project is primarily an application for software engineering project managers who are currently in-charge of
a team of large employees and many projects. This application employs the use of a Command Line Interface(CLI) to easily
navigate through the application which contributes to the efficiency and user-friendliness of the end product.
This application allows managers to keep track of all the employees and their related background information such as their
GitHub account username and relevant skills.

Additionally, it also helps to keep track of all the projects that the manager
is currently involved with and key details of the project such the client, deadline and milestones can also be stored.
Through the combination of the two main components, the application allows the storing and viewing of all the employees
working on particular project and all the projects currently under a single employee among other functionalities.

== Background Information

When first seeing our application, many of you may wonder what is the significance
behind this project. Well, the current issues cannot be seen at the surface level and requires
a deeper look. To present all the information in a nutshell, our application provides
everything that a manager will ever need at the tip of his fingertips. Being able to better
handle project and man management leads to a more organized workflow and inevitably, a more
productive environment which can set a strong foundation for the lifecycle of various projects.

In addition, the inability to track the progress of a project has been cited as one of the top reasons
as to why a product fails, and thus our application aims to potentially solve this problem
by having both a milestones feature and a task manager to mainly see not only what has been completed, but
also the proposed schedule for the weeks ahead until the project is due for completion.

== Before We Begin
This section will outline key things to take note of before reading the user guide.
The information provided in this section will be useful in understanding certain
symbols and terms used further on in the user guide.
