== Introduction

Pocket Project is primarily an application for software engineering project managers who are currently in-charge of
a team of large employees and many projects. This application employs the use of a Command Line Interface(CLI) to easily
navigate through the application which contributes to the efficiency and user-friendliness of the end product.
This application allows managers to keep track of all the employees and their related background information such as their
GitHub account username and relevant skills.

Additionally, it also helps to keep track of all the projects that the manager
is currently involved with and key details of the project such the client, deadline and milestones can also be stored.
Through the combination of the two main components, the application allows the storing and viewing of all the employees
working on particular project and all the projects currently under a single employee among other functionalities.

== Background Information

When first seeing our application, many of you may wonder what is the significance
behind this project. Well, the current issues cannot be seen at the surface level and requires
a deeper look. To present all the information in a nutshell, our application provides
everything that a manager will ever need at the tip of his fingertips. Being able to better
handle project and man management leads to a more organized workflow and inevitably, a more
productive environment which can set a strong foundation for the lifecycle of various projects.

In addition, the inability to track the progress of a project has been cited as one of the top reasons
as to why a product fails, and thus our application aims to potentially solve this problem
by having both a milestones feature and a task manager to mainly see not only what has been completed, but
also the proposed schedule for the weeks ahead until the project is due for completion.

== Before We Begin
This section will outline key things to take note of before reading the user guide.
The information provided in this section will be useful in understanding certain
symbols and terms used further on in the user guide.

=== Add an employee/milestone/user story to a project : `addto`

==== Add an employee to a project: `addto employee`

You can add an employee to any projects already created in the Pocket Project application. You can
do this by first listing all employees using the basic `list employees` command or by first filtering all the
employees with the `find employee` or `find skills` command, and then choosing the index of the employee
in the displayed list.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME employee EMPLOYEE_INDEX`


|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]| The employee at the specified `EMPLOYEE_INDEX` is added to the
project specified by the `PROJECT_NAME`. The index refers to the serial number (one-based indexing) shown in
the displayed list of employees.
|===
|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="60"]| The `EMPLOYEE_INDEX` must be a positive integer and cannot be
larger than the size of the displayed list.
|===

.. `addto Apollo employee 5` +
Adds the 5th person in the displayed filtered employee list to project "Apollo".

You can refer to the screenshot below to have a clearer picture of how it works
and looks like.

.*Adding an employee to a project*
image::ug-addtoemployee.png[]



|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]| As shown in the figure above, instead of calling
the `list employees` command, we can simple click on the `employees` tab located at the top of the side tab panel.
|===


==== Add a milestone to a project: `addto milestone`

Adds a milestone to a project.

Format: `addto PROJ_NAME milestone MS_DETAILS MS_DATE`

image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
Date must be of the format DD/MM/YYYY

* `addto Apollo milestone Completed UI for program 23/11/2015` +
Milestone added to project "Apollo".


==== Add a task to a project milestone: `addto projecttask`

Adds a task to a project milestone.

Format: `addto PROJ_NAME projecttask [n/TASK_NAME] [m/MILESTONE_INDEX]`

image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]
Adds the project task to the milestone at the specified `MILESTONE_INDEX`.
The index refers to the index number (one-based) shown in the displayed list of milestones.

image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
The index must be a *positive integer* and cannot be larger than the size of the list.

Example:

* `addto Apollo projecttask n/Create feature XYZ m/1` +
   Adds to the milestone at index 1 in project with name "Apollo", a new project task called "Create feature XYZ".

* `addto Apollo projecttask m/2 n/Modify feature XYZ` +
   Adds to the milestone at index 2 in project with name "Apollo", a new project task called "Modify feature XYZ".

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
There is no specific order for either the project task name or the milestone index so either way is acceptable.

==== Add a user story to a project: `addto userstory`

Adds a user story to a project.

Format: `addto PROJ_NAME userstory i/STORY_IMPORTANCE STORY`

`STORY_IMPORTANCE`: The priority/importance level of the user story, ranging from 1 to 3. 3 being the most
important and 1 being the least.

`STORY`: A valid user story must be in the following format - as a ... i want to ... so that ...

image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
Note that `as a`, `i want to` and `so that` are keywords which help us to segment your user story into the respective categories: user, function and reason.
Hence these keywords cannot be used more than once.

Examples:

* `addto Apollo userstory i/1 as a user i want to try out new things so that i can have fun`

* `addto Apollo userstory as a lazy user i want to have shortcuts for my commands i/2`

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
