== Introduction

Pocket Project is primarily an application for software engineering project managers who are currently in-charge of
a team of large employees and many projects. This application employs the use of a Command Line Interface(CLI) to easily
navigate through the application which contributes to the efficiency and user-friendliness of the end product.
This application allows managers to keep track of all the employees and their related background information such as their
GitHub account username and relevant skills.

Additionally, it also helps to keep track of all the projects that the manager
is currently involved with and key details of the project such the client, deadline and milestones can also be stored.
Through the combination of the two main components, the application allows the storing and viewing of all the employees
working on particular project and all the projects currently under a single employee among other functionalities.

== Background Information

When first seeing our application, many of you may wonder what is the significance
behind this project. Well, the current issues cannot be seen at the surface level and requires
a deeper look. To present all the information in a nutshell, our application provides
everything that a manager will ever need at the tip of his fingertips. Being able to better
handle project and man management leads to a more organized workflow and inevitably, a more
productive environment which can set a strong foundation for the lifecycle of various projects.

In addition, the inability to track the progress of a project has been cited as one of the top reasons
as to why a product fails, and thus our application aims to potentially solve this problem
by having both a milestones feature and a task manager to mainly see not only what has been completed, but
also the proposed schedule for the weeks ahead until the project is due for completion.

== Before We Begin
This section will outline key things to take note of before reading the user guide.
The information provided in this section will be useful in understanding certain
symbols and terms used further on in the user guide.

=== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `pocketproject.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Pocket Project.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds as shown below.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list employee`* : lists all employees

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Navigating the interface

.Pocket Project UI with different components
image::ui_annotated.png[]

As shown above, there are 5 main components in Pocket Project interface:

. Command Box: where you key in the command
. Result Box: show the result of the command that is keyed in
. Side tab Panel: display either project list or employee list
. Prev/Next Button: to navigate through the project/employee details
. Detail panel: display details of an employee/project

There are several detail panels to display the details of the employees and the projects as shown below. You can toggle between these panel by using the Prev/Next Button.

.Detail Panels of an employee [1] Summary: display name, skills, phone, email of the employee [2] Projects: the list of projects the employee is working on [3] Github: github page of the employee

//end::find[]

=== View the details of employees or projects : `view`

==== View details of an employee: `view employee`

When viewing the employee, the GitHub page of the employee
will also be loaded.

=== Add an employee/milestone/user story to a project : `addto`

==== Add an employee to a project: `addto employee`

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME employee EMPLOYEE_INDEX`

image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]
Adds the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
The index refers to the index number (one-based) shown in the displayed list of employees.

image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
The index must be a *positive integer* and cannot be larger than the size of the list.

Examples:

* `list employees` +
`addto Apollo employee 2` +
Adds the 2nd person in the displayed employee list to project "Apollo".

Adds the 5th person in the displayed employee list to project "Apollo".

==== Add a milestone to a project: `addto milestone`

Adds a milestone to a project.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME milestone MS_DETAILS MS_DATE`

image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
Date must be of the format DD/MM/YYYY

Examples:

* `addto Apollo milestone Completed UI for program 23/11/2015` +
Milestone added to project "Apollo".


==== Add a task to a project milestone: `addto projecttask`

Adds a task to a project milestone.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME projecttask [n/TASK_NAME] [m/MILESTONE_INDEX]`

image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]

   Adds to the milestone at index 2 in project with name "Apollo", a new project task called "Modify feature XYZ".

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
There is no specific order for either the project task name or the milestone index so either way is acceptable.

==== Add a User Story to a project: `addto userstory`

You can add a user story to a project.
In case you didn't know what user stories are, they are tools to capture the description of a feature from an end-user's perspective.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME userstory i/STORY_IMPORTANCE STORY`

image:ug-notepad.png[width="40"]
`STORY_IMPORTANCE`: The priority/importance level of the user story, ranging from 1 to 3. 3 being the most
important and 1 being the least.

image:ug-notepad.png[width="40"]
`STORY`: A valid user story must be in the following format - as a ... i want to ... so that ...

image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
Note that `as a`, `i want to` and `so that` are keywords which help us to segment your user story into the respective categories: user, function and reason.
Hence these keywords cannot be used more than once and needs to be included in a valid user story.

Examples:

. `addto Apollo userstory as a new user i want to have a clean UI so that i can navigate easily i/2`

. `addto Apollo userstory i/1 as a user i want to try out new things so that i can have fun`

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
You can input the importance level or the actual user story in any order.

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
A valid user story can also be simply: `as a ... i want to...`.
E.g `as a user i want to log in` is a valid user story.

Upon a successful addition of a user story, you should be able to see the new user story in the list of user stories. You may need to toggle the buttons to get to the correct panel.

Refer to the diagram below to see how the new user story is shown.
