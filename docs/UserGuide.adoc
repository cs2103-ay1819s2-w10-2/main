== Introduction

PocketProject is primarily an application for software engineering project managers who are currently in-charge of
a team of large employees and many projects. This application employs the use of a Command Line Interface(CLI) to easily
navigate through the application which contributes to the efficiency and user-friendliness of the end product.
This application allows managers to keep track of all the employees and their related background information such as their
GitHub account username and relevant skills. Additionally, it also helps to keep track of all the projects that the manager
is currently involved with and key details of the project such the client, deadline and milestones can also be stored.
Through the combination of the two main components, the application allows the storing and viewing of all the employees
working on particular project and all the projects currently under a single employee among other functionalities.
