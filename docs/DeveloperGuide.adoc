== Introduction

PocketProject is primarily an application for software engineering project managers who are currently in-charge of
a large team of employees and many projects. This application employs the use of a Command Line Interface(CLI) to easily
navigate through the application which contributes to the efficiency and user-friendliness of the end product.
This application allows managers to keep track of all the employees and their related background information such as their
GitHub account username and relevant skills. Additionally, it also helps to keep track of all the projects that the manager
is currently involved with and key details of the project such the client, deadline and milestones can also be stored.
Through the combination of the two main components, the application allows the storing and viewing of all the employees
working on particular project and all the projects currently under a single employee among other functionalities.

== Background Information

When first seeing our application, many of you may wonder what is the significance
behind this project. Well, the current issues cannot be seen at the surface level and requires
a deeper look. To present all the information in a nutshell, our application provides
everything that a manager will ever need at the tip of his fingertips. Being able to better
handle project and man management leads to a more organized workflow and inevitably, a more
productive environment which can set a strong foundation for the lifecycle of various projects.

In addition, the inability to track the progress of a project has been cited as one of the top reasons
as to why a product fails, and thus our application aims to potentially solve this problem
by having both a milestones feature and a task manager to mainly see not only what has been completed, but
also the proposed schedule for the weeks ahead until the project is due for completion.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+

|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]|JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
                                      Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.
|===

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
                                      Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
|===

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/pocketproject` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/pocketproject`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.
|===

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)
|===


==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete employee 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete employee 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `PocketProjectParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a employee).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete employee 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Pocket Project data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Skill` list in `Pocket Project`, which `Employee` can reference. This would allow `Pocket Project` to only require one `Skill` object per unique `Skill`, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Skill` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pocket Project data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// skill::addTo[]
=== Add employee/milestone/user story to projects feature
==== Current Implementation

This feature focuses on the adding of employees or milestones to a selected project and is mainly facilitated
by the model component of the PocketProject application. This feature supports two main commands:

* `addto [project name] employee [employee index]` -- removes the employee at index `[employee index]` in the list of all employees in the Pocket Project application.
* `addto [project name] milestone [milestone details]` -- adds the milestone specified in `[milestone details]` to the list of milestones in the project named `[project name]`.
* `addto [project name] userstory i/IMPORTANCE [story]` -- adds the user story specified in `[story]` to the list of user stories in the project with name `[project name]`

These operations are supported by the methods in the `Model` interface: `Model#addEmployeeTo(Project, Employee)`, `Model#addMilestoneTo(Project, Milestone)` and `Model#addUserStoryTo(Projectm UserStory)`.
These three methods only take in the project and employee/milestone as arguments as the correct Employee/Milestone/UserStory object would be located by
`AddEmployeeToCommand#excute()`, `AddMilestoneToCommand#execute()` or `AddUserStoryToCommand#execute()` before the methods of `Model` are called.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addition of employee/milestone/user story to a project feature behaves at each step.

`AddEmployeeTo Command`

Step 1. The user enters the command `list employees'. The app displays the list of employees in the Pocket Project by executing the `list` command.

Step 2. The user enters `addto Apollo employee 1`. The `LogicManager` passes the entered string to the `PocketProjectParser`. The `PocketProjectParser` parses the string received and identifies the command as falling under the class of `AddToCommand`
by the `addto` keyword and passes the rest of the string to the `AddToCommandParser` to identify which type of `AddToCommand` is being executed and what are the arguments.
The `AddToCommandParser` then creates command object and passes it to the `LogicManager` to be executed. The command execution will check the validity of the arguments and then call the methods of the `Model` component to add the corresponding object.

`AddMilestoneTo Command`

Step 1. The user enters the command `addto Apollo milestone [milestone details]'. The rest of the execution process is
similar to Step 2 of the `AddEmployeeTo Command` mentioned above. Only the object added is decided between an employee, user story or a
milestone depending on the user input.

`AddUserStoryTo Command`
Step 1. The user enters the command `addto Apollo userstory i/1 as a user i want to view user stories so that i can track them`. The rest of the
execution process is similar to Step 2 of the `AddEmployeeTo Command`.Only the object added is decided between an employee, user story or a
milestone depending on the user input.

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
Tip: The `[project name]` entered must be valid and exists in the app. The `[employee index]` given must refer to some existing employee. Also,
the milestone added needs to be of the correct format. If not, exceptions would be thrown during the execution of the command.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to structure the user story details to be inputted into the project

Alternative 1: Use a `regex` to indicate the importance/priority of a user story, then have the user key in the user story in the specified format `as a...i want to...so that...`(Current implementation)

Alternative 2: Use only `regex` to denote the different parts of a user story. For example, `i/` to denote the importance level, `u/` to denote user etc...

Alternative 3: Store the entire string as given by the user as it is and not parse the input.

Using alternative 3 is the simplest and most straight forward way to handle the user input, but it does not provide much functionality. As user stories should be organised and easy to read as a list,
we will need to use some sort of `TableView` or `ListView` to view the stories. Thus, using alternative 3 will only allow the entire string to be generated and is not user friendly.
Between alternative 2 and alternative 1, alternative 2 provides an easier way for the program to generate and partition the input using `regex` expressions. However, as there are many parts to a user
story, having to remember 4 different `regex` expressions may be hard for a user to remember and may be inconvenient. Using alternative 1 is a mix of both 2 and 3, which allows abit more flexibility
and smoothness for a user by allowing them to type in full sentences how they would normally do for a user story, while allowing proper classification of the components of the story to be able to
be displayed in the UI component as a `TableView`.


==== Future Planned Implementations

The following additional features are scheduled to be implemented in future version.

1. Add an alias to to the addto commands so that it is more user-friendly for users of this application. Users
can key in the two above mentioned commands by replacing `employee` with `e` and `milestone` with `m`. The commands can be
input as such:

* `addto [project name] e [employee index]` -- removes the employee at index `[employee index]` in the list of all employees in the Pocket Project application.
* `addto [project name] m [milestone details]` -- adds the milestone specified in `[milestone details]` to the list of milestones in the project named `[project name]`.

The commands will be processed in the same way without any other changes.

// end::addto[]

// skill::removefrom[]
=== Remove employee/milestone from projects feature
==== Current Implementation

The removing of employee,milestone or user story from projects is facilitated by the model component of the PocketProject.
This feature currently supports these three commands:

* `removefrom [project name] employee [employee index]` -- removes the employee at index `[employee index]` in the list of employees in the project named `[project name]`.
* `removefrom [project name] milestone [milestone index]` -- removes the milestone at index `[milestone index]` in the list of milestones in the project named `[project name]`.
* `removefrom [project name] userstory [userstory index]` -- removes the user story at index `[userstory index]` in the list of user stories in the project named `[project name]`.

These operations are supported by the methods in the `Model` interface: `Model#removeEmployeeFrom(Project, Employee)`, `Model#removeMilestoneFrom(Project, Milestone)` and `Model#removeUserStoryFrom(Project, UserStory)`.
The methods does not take in indices as arguments since the corresponding Employee,Milestone or UserStory object associated with the Project object would be found by `RemoveEmployeeFromCommand#excute()`, `RemoveMilestoneFromCommand#execute()` or `RemoveUserStoryFromCommand#execute()`
before the methods of `Model` are called.
The sequence diagram for the execution of the removing of employee from a project is as follows, the sequence for the removal of milestone and user stories are similar:

image::remove_employee_from_sequence_diagram.png[width="1000"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the removal of employee/milestone/user story feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters the command `view project Apollo'. The app displays the list of employees and milestones in the project named "Apollo" by executing the `view` command.

Step 2. The user enters `removefrom Apollo employee 1`. The `LogicManager` passes the entered string to the `PocketProjectParser`. The `PocketProjectParser` parses the string received and identifies the command as falling under the class of `RemoveFromCommand` (which constitutes of `RemoveEmployeeFromCommand`
and `RemoveMilestoneFromCommand` by the `removefrom` keyword and passes the rest of the string to the `RemoveFromCommandParser` to identify which type of `RemoveFromCommand` is being executed and what are the arguments.
The `RemoveFromCommandParser` then creates command object and passes it to the `LogicManager` to be executed. The command execution will check the validity of the arguments and then call the methods of the `Model` component to remove the corresponding objects.

Step 3. The user executes 'removefrom Apollo milestone 2'. The execution of this command is similar to step 2, just that the type of object changes from `Employee` to `Milestone`.

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
Tip: The `[project name]` entered must be valid and exists in the app. The `[employee index]` or `[milestone index]` given must refer to some existing employee or milestone. If not, exceptions would be thrown during the execution of the command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the command string (e.g. `removefrom Apollo employee 1`) is parsed

Alternative 1: Let `PocketProjectParser` handle the whole string and construct the command.

Alternative 2: Having 2 parsing stages where the `PocketProjectParser` identify that the command string is trying to execute a `RemoveFromCommand` from the `removefrom` key word, then passes
the rest of the string to another specialized `RemoveFromCommandParser`. (current implementation)

Using alternative 2 is better  as it provides better abstraction as the details of the 2 different types of `RemoveFromCommand` will be hidden away, hence it is more in line with OOP principles.
There will also be less clutter in `PocketProjectParser` as there are already a lot of other commands being parsed.

// end::removefrom[]

=== Find Employee/Project/Skill feature
==== Current Implementation
For the current `find` feature, there are 3 main commands that the user can execute:

    1. `find employee [keywords]` - display employees with name containing keywords
    2. `find project [keywords]` - display projects with name containing keywords
    3. `find skill [keywords]` - display employees who has skills matching the keywords

The `FindCommandParser` differentiate these 3 commands based on the `COMMAND_KEYWORDS` entered by the users (e.g. employee/project/skill).

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find employee` command works:

image::findcommand_sequence_diagram.png[width="1000"]

Usage Scenario example for `find employee`:

1. User executes `find employee John` to look for employees whose names contains the word 'John'.
2. `PocketProjectParser` will parse and identify the command as a `FindCommand` and pass on the argument `employee John` to `FindCommandParser`.
3.  `FindCommandParser` identify the command based on the `COMMAND_KEYWORD` employee.
4. `find employee` command is executed. Employees with name consisting the keywords are filtered out from the employeelist and the `filteredEmployees` list which is the list displayed on the ui is updated.

The working mechanism for `find project` is similar to `find employee`. Instead of updating the `filteredEmployees`, `filteredProjects` is updated instead to display the list of projects with name consisting the keywords.

For `find skill` command, the `List<Skills>skills` from employee is retrieved as a `String` to match against the keywords. Then the matched employees are filtered and displayed on the ui.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `find` command is parsed
Alternative 1: Have a nested `FindCommandParser` (current implementation)

Alternative 2: Let `PocketProjectParser` handle parsing of all the `find` commands

Using Alternative 1 is better as it provides better abstraction as the details of the 3 different commands will be hidden away. Hence it is more in line with OOP principles. There will also be less clutter in `FindCommandParser` as there are already a lot of other commands being parsed.

// skill::undoredo[]

=== List Employee/Project feature
==== Current implementation
For the current list feature, there are 2 main commands that the user can execute:

    1. `list employee` - displays all employees
    2. `list project` - displays all projects

The `ListCommandParser` will parse the user input based on the `COMMAND_KEYWORD` entered by the user, and then execute the appropriate command based on the keyword given.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list employee command works:

image::listcommand_sequence_diagram.png[width="1000"]

Usage Scenario example for `list employee`:

1.	User executes `list employee` to list all employees in PocketProject.
2.	`PocketProjectParser` will parse and identify the command as a `ListCommand` and pass the argument employee to `ListCommandParser`.
3.	`ListCommandParser` identifies the command to execute based on the `COMMAND_KEYWORD` and returns a `ListEmployeeCommand`.
4.	`LogicManager` then executes `ListEmployeeCommand`. All the employees in PocketProject will be returned by the `filteredEmployees` list.

The mechanism for `list project` is similar to `list employee`, apart from the fact that a `ListProjectCommand` is executed instead.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How `list command` is parsed
Alternative 1: Have a separate command parser for all `list` commands (current implementation)

Alternative 2: Let `PocketProjectParser` handle parsing of all the `list` commands

Using Alternative 1 is better as it provides better abstraction as the `listCommandParser` will handle all `list` commands. It also reduces the cluttering in the main `PocketProjectParser`.

// skill::stats[]
=== [Proposed] Stats feature
==== Planned Implementation

The displaying of statistics in Pocket Project will be facilitated by the model component. This feature is
planned to support 1 main command:

* `stats` -- Displays the total number of projects and the respective number of ongoing and completed projects

The operation will be supported by the methods in the `Model` interface: `Model#getProjectList()` and `Model#getCompletedProjectList`.
These two methods each will retrieve an unmodifiable list of ongoing projects and completed projects respectively.


The following sequence diagram shows how the stats command will work:

image::stats_sequence_diagram.png[width="1000"]

Usage Scenario example for `stats`:

1.	User executes `stats` to view project statistics in Pocket Project.
2.	`PocketProjectParser` will parse and identify the command as a `StatsCommand` and returns a `StatsCommand`.
3.	`LogicManager` then executes `StatsCommand`, calling the `Model#getProjectList()` and `Model#getCompletedProjectList()` methods
 which return the list of ongoing and completed projects respectively.
4.  `StatsCommand` then returns the total number of projects and the respective number of ongoing and completed projects.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the number of projects is obtained.
Alternative 1: Obtain the required project lists through `Model` and and get the size of the lists.

Alternative 2: Let `UniqueProjectList` keep track of the number of projects and implement a `UniqueProjectList#getSize()` method which is called by `StatsCommand`.

Using Alternative 1 is better as the Pocket Project statistics only need to be displayed when the user executes `stats`.
Alternative 2 would require additional checks to ensure that there is live update of project statistics in `UniqueProjectList` every time a project is added, deleted or completed.


// end::stats[]

=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPocketProject`.
It extends `PocketProject` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `pocketProjectStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPocketProject#commit()` -- Saves the current pocket project state in its history.
* `VersionedPocketProject#undo()` -- Restores the previous pocket project state from its history.
* `VersionedPocketProject#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone pocket project state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPocketProject()`, `Model#undoPocketProject()` and `Model#redoPocketProject()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPocketProject` will be initialized with the initial pocket project state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single pocket project state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th employee in the pocket project. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitPocketProject()`, causing the modified state of the pocket project after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `pocketProjectStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted pocket project state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new employee. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitPocketProject()`, causing another modified pocket project state to be saved into the `pocketProjectStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPocketProject()`, so the pocket project state will not be saved into the `pocketProjectStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the employee was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoPocketProject()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Pocket Project state, and restores the Pocket Project to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Pocket Project state, then there are no previous Pocket Project states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoPocketProject()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoPocketProject()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Pocket Project to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `pocketProjectStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Pocket Project state, then there are no undone Pocket Project states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoPocketProject()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the Pocket Project, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitPocketProject()`, `Model#undoPocketProject()` or `Model#redoPocketProject()`. Thus, the `pocketProjectStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitPocketProject()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `pocketProjectStateList`, all pocket project states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Pocket Project.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the employee being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of Pocket Project states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedPocketProject`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/blob/master/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Pocket Project depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
