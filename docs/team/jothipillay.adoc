== Pocket Project: About the Application
Pocket Project was built by my team and I in our second year in NUS while pursuing a Computer Science degree. We were
inspired to create this application as we sought ways to improve efficiency in project management.
This application was created with the intention of supporting software engineering project managers
throughout the lifetime of a project, from the planning phase until it is delivered to the client.

Pocket Project's *core functionality* includes:
* Adding employees and projects to the application
* Adding user stories to a project which is essential for planning.
* Assigning projects to employees based on their individual skill sets.
* Monitoring the progress of a project through milestones and tasks.

== Summary Of My Contributions
In this section, I detail some of my key contributions towards this application in terms of both features and
documentation.

*Major Contribution: Smart Dates*

* *What it does*: This allows the user flexibility in keying in dates when required and supports 2 main sub-formats.
** Firstly, it supports a fixed date format where users can key in a date according to *"DD/MM/YYYY"*.
** Secondly, it also accepts flexible input from the user. If the user wants a day relative to the current day, he/she can simply type *"today/tomorrow/yesterday"*. Otherwise
if the user wants a day relative to current week, he/she can input *"this/next/last week DAY_OF_WEEK"*. Lastly if the user wants a date
relative to the current month, he/she can simply go for *"this/next/last month DAY_OF_MONTH"*.
** The validity of the target date is also verified.

* *Why it is useful and important*: As expected, when it comes to a project manager application, the use of dates are used
extensively in other features throughout the application. In addition, there is likely to be changes
in dates of milestones or deadlines throughout the lifetime a project. So, this feature enables the user a quick and user-friendly way
to execute certain commands, greatly improving efficiency. Some of these commands include,
** Setting of dates when creating and completing projects and milestones.
** Editing of the all components with dates inside a particular project.
** Finding projects that are due by a certain *DEADLINE*.

* *Highlights*: The date input is parsed by a special *Pocket Project Date Parser* that was designed specifically to parse
both the fixed and flexible date formats. In fact, the  user does not even need to explicitly indicate his/her intended format as the
parser is designed to differentiate based on the input string received.
