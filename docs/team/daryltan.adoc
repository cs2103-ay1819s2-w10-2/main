== About the project

My team and I were tasked to enhance an open source, basic command line interface (CLI) addressbook for our Software engineering project.
Given the constraints that the final product had to use CLI as the primary mode of input and that it had to be functional without an internet connection for testing purposes,
we decided to morph it into a project management application called Pocket Project.
This upgraded application enables project managers to keep track of everything about ongoing and completed projects, as well as the data of employees under the manager, all in one place.

My role was to design and write the code for the `addto projecttask`, `edit projecttask` and `removefrom projecttask` features. The following sections will explain in further detail about the above-mentioned features,
as well as what I have documented in the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to add, edit and remove tasks to and from a project in the application.
[grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]| Milestones in a project give a broad overview of what needs to be done to complete a project. Tasks in a milestone are like a to-do list for keeping track of what needs to be done to reach the next milestone.
|===
** What it does: The `[aqua]#addto projecttask#` command adds a task to a milestone in a project. The `[aqua]#edit projecttask#` command allows the manager to set the status of the task to ongoing or complete or to move the task to another milestone within the project.
   The `[aqua]#removefrom projecttask#` command removes the specified task completely from the milestone.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it greatly enhances the level of organization and control which the manager has while planning out a schedule for projects.
** Highlights: The implementation of this feature was rather unique and required a slightly creative approach  different from how other features were implemented as it is a component of milestones which in turn is a component of project.
   Most other features in Pocket Project directly interact with either employees or projects, unlike that of project tasks which interacts only with milestones in a project.
** Credits: The code for `addto` command parser which I extended for the project task feature was done by my teammate Jothinandan Pillay.

*Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.3` (2 releases) on GitHub
*** Set up kanban with automation on Github
** Minor code changes:
*** Renamed instances of person to employee, addressbook to Pocket Project and tags to skills. (Pull requests [https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-2/main/pull/27[#27]] [https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-2/main/pull/57[#57]][https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-2/main/pull/91[#91]])

== Contributions to the User Guide

The section contains my contributions to the user guide regarding the `[aqua]#addto projecttask#` command.

=== Add a task to a project milestone: `addto projecttask`

Adds a task to a project milestone.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME projecttask [n/TASK_NAME] [m/MILESTONE_INDEX]`

image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]
Adds the project task to the milestone at the specified `MILESTONE_INDEX`.
The index refers to the index number (one-based) shown in the displayed list of milestones.

image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
The index must be a *positive integer* and cannot be larger than the size of the list.

Example:

* `addto Apollo projecttask n/Create feature XYZ m/1` +
   Adds to the milestone at index 1 in project with name "Apollo", a new project task called "Create feature XYZ".

* `addto Apollo projecttask m/2 n/Modify feature XYZ` +
   Adds to the milestone at index 2 in project with name "Apollo", a new project task called "Modify feature XYZ".

image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
There is no specific order for either the project task name or the milestone index so either way is acceptable.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Below are the sections which I contributed to in the Developer guide for a planned `stats` feature.

// skill::stats[]
=== [Proposed] Stats feature
==== Planned Implementation

The displaying of statistics in Pocket Project will be facilitated by the model component. This feature is
planned to support 1 main command:

* `stats` -- Displays the total number of projects and the respective number of ongoing and completed projects

The operation will be supported by the methods in the `Model` interface: `Model#getProjectList()` and `Model#getCompletedProjectList`.
These two methods each will retrieve an unmodifiable list of ongoing projects and completed projects respectively.


The following sequence diagram shows how the stats command will work:

image::stats_sequence_diagram.png[width="1000"]

Usage Scenario example for `stats`:

1.	User executes `stats` to view project statistics in Pocket Project.
2.	`PocketProjectParser` will parse and identify the command as a `StatsCommand` and returns a `StatsCommand`.
3.	`LogicManager` then executes `StatsCommand`, calling the `Model#getProjectList()` and `Model#getCompletedProjectList()` methods
 which return the list of ongoing and completed projects respectively.
4.  `StatsCommand` then returns the total number of projects and the respective number of ongoing and completed projects.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the number of projects is obtained.
Alternative 1: Obtain the required project lists through `Model` and and get the size of the lists.

Alternative 2: Let `UniqueProjectList` keep track of the number of projects and implement a `UniqueProjectList#getSize()` method which is called by `StatsCommand`.

Using Alternative 1 is better as the Pocket Project statistics only need to be displayed when the user executes `stats`.
Alternative 2 would require additional checks to ensure that there is live update of project statistics in `UniqueProjectList` every time a project is added, deleted or completed.


// end::stats[]
