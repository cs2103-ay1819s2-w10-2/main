== About the project

Welcome to my Project Portfolio Page! My team and I were tasked to enhance an open source, basic command line interface (CLI) addressbook for our Software engineering project.
Given the constraints that the final product had to use CLI as the primary mode of input and that it had to be functional without an internet connection for testing purposes,
we decided to morph it into a project management application called Pocket Project.

This upgraded application enables project managers to keep track of everything about ongoing and completed projects, as well as the data of employees under the manager, all in one place.

My role was to design and write the code for the `addto projecttask`, `update projecttask` and `removefrom projecttask` features. The following sections will explain in further detail about the above-mentioned features,
as well as what I have documented in the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

|===
|Symbol |Meaning

|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]
|The note pad icon indicates any useful tips or things that users
need to take note of while using the Pocket Project application.

|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
|The light bulb icon indicates any shortcuts
that users can use while using the Pocket Project application.

|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
|The exclamation mark icon indicates any warnings that users
 can take note of while using the Pocket Project application.

|```addto```| A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

|```[aqua]#addto#```| A grey highlight with light blue text indicates this is an abbreviated command shortened for the sake of brevity.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Feature added*: I added the ability to add, update and remove project tasks to and from a project in the application.

|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]| Milestones in a project give a broad overview of what needs to be done to complete a project. Project tasks in a milestone are like a to-do list for keeping track of what needs to be done to reach the next milestone.

.*How the milestones and tasks feature looks like*

** What it does: The `[aqua]#addto projecttask#` command adds a task to a milestone in a project. The `[aqua]#update projecttask#` command allows the manager to set the status of the task to ongoing, on hold or complete.
   The `[aqua]#removefrom projecttask#` command removes the specified task completely from the milestone.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it greatly enhances the level of organization and control which the manager has while planning out a schedule for projects.
** Highlights: The implementation of this feature was rather unique and required a slightly creative approach  different from how other features were implemented as it is a component of milestones which in turn is a component of project.
   Most other features in Pocket Project directly interact with either employees or projects, unlike that of project tasks which interacts only with milestones in a project.
** Credits: The code for `addto` command parser which I extended for the project task feature and the original milestone code which I enhanced was done by my teammate Jothinandan Pillay.
   The code for `update` command parser was done by my teammate Jeff Gan. The code for `removefrom` command parser was done by my teammate Lin Dehui.
