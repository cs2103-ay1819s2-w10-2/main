* PocketProject (Project Manager)

* This is a desktop Project Manager application. Most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface) and there is
* also a GUI to support the system. It is an application using Java as the main programming language. 

* It is intended for managers are in charge of many projects and who have a large number of employees assigned to each project at any 
* given time. It helps managers to effectively manage any of their projects by being able to view employees assigned to the projects, 
* skils required for the project, budget and timeline for the project among other things. 

* It is written in OOP fashion and has a sophisticated GUI with an in-built brower. There are also automated test cases already in-built
* using both automated GUI testing and JUnit Tests.

** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
