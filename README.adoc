* PocketProject (Project Manager)

* This is a desktop Project Manager application. Most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface)
and there is   also a GUI to support the system. It is an application using Java as the main programming language.

* It is intended for managers who are in charge of many software engineering projects and who have a large number of
employees assigned to each project at any given time.

* Managers can view project details such as
** Employees assigned
** Deadline
** Client
** Milestones
